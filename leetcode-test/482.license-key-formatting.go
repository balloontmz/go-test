 * Testcase Example:  '"5F3Z-2e-9-w"\n4'
 *
 * You are given a license key represented as a string S which consists only
 * alphanumeric character and dashes. The string is separated into N+1 groups
 * by N dashes.
 * 
 * Given a number K, we would want to reformat the strings such that each group
 * contains exactly K characters, except for the first group which could be
 * shorter than K, but still must contain at least one character. Furthermore,
 * there must be a dash inserted between two groups and all lowercase letters
 * should be converted to uppercase.
 * 
 * Given a non-empty string S and a number K, format the string according to
 * the rules described above.
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: S = "5F3Z-2e-9-w", K = 4
 * 
 * Output: "5F3Z-2E9W"
 * 
 * Explanation: The string S has been split into two parts, each part has 4
 * characters.
 * Note that the two extra dashes are not needed and can be removed.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * Input: S = "2-5g-3-J", K = 2
 * 
 * Output: "2-5G-3J"
 * 
 * Explanation: The string S has been split into three parts, each part has 2
 * characters except the first part as it could be shorter as mentioned
 * above.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Note:
 * 
 * The length of string S will not exceed 12,000, and K is a positive integer.
 * String S consists only of alphanumerical characters (a-z and/or A-Z and/or
 * 0-9) and dashes(-).
 * String S is non-empty.
